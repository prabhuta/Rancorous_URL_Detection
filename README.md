## Rancorous_URL_Detection

Rancorous URL Detection is a machine learning initiative that employs natural language processing (NLP) to detect and categorize malicious URLs. The project, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, utilizes advanced models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNET. The data is trained and tested using these models, and their accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated. The model with the highest accuracy is selected for final use.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rancorous-url-detection.git
    cd rancorous-url-detection
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
